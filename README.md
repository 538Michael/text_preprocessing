# text_preprocessing
This project is about getting old journals from Brazil, from ages like 1840~1920, scan these journals to get txts with what is written in the journals, the txts got aren't 100%, because the images are not always good or there are writing errors, so the main ideia of this project is treat these txts generated by the scan program.
